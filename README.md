# Knuffel

This is my approach of creating a Yahtzee (Kniffel) like Game for up to 4 Players!
I´m learning C# since a few months now. This is my very first "bigger" project!
I did a bit of refactoring, and lots of bug hunting.
For sure there will be a lot of potential to improve and optimize the code, but for the moment, considering my skill level I´m happy with the result right now. (Constructive criticism is very welcome!)
